## CPSC 120

* Lab 9

  Lab 9 aprt 2 was one of my favorite labs this semester because it was the first time I ever used an input file. It was interesting to me to learn how small spellchecks we use everyday actually work. The most satisfying part was when I finally got the spellchecks to come out right. 

* Lab 12

  Lab 12 part 1 was my favorite lab this whole semester because of the animation that we got to make. Growing up and even now I have always found the idea of animation very cool and interesting. It was also the last lab of the class so it felt like accomplishment when me and my lab partner finished it.  

* Lab 2

   Lab 2 was also one of my favorite labs that we did in the class. The reasons of why is because we got to learn the 3 most important steps in making the code work. We learned how to clone a git repository, correct format, and remove lint.
